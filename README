use this directory to conduct fitting with visibilities
I'll use dynesty (or maybe emcee later on) to sample the probabilities


copy tools from pdspy. don't import pdspy as a module



The structure of this directory is as follows

- models
    - model1.py
    - model2.py
    ...

- projects
    - project1
    - project2
    ...

- setup.py
- mcvis
    - __init__.py
    ...


Store the models in the models directory, because in some cases, we may want to call the model from elsewhere. Multiple projects may want to use the same model. 


compile the mcvis first with setup.py
